## Week Two - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is Webpack and why is it useful?
- Wepback is a package for node projects that is similar to the asset pipeline in Rails. It looks at your asset files in your project (JS, CSS etc) and packages them up into one file per asset (so one js, one css) for production. There is a difference between what we as developers want/use to make our lives easier - multiple files, white space etc. and what the broswer wants - one file, no white space and webpack takes what we have written and makes it easier for the browser to read it. 

2. When do you want to use event delegation?
- Event delegation is good in cases where you might have memory leak - you tied an event listener to something that is no longer in the DOM and so the program is "listening" for something that will never happen and wasting memory use on it. Event delegation ties the listener to the parent object that then analyzes the event to see if it matches exactly what you are looking for. 

3. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?
- arrow notation vs. function notation; var vs. let and const; string interpretation 

4. How are you using the MVC design pattern in your Quantified Self project?
- we have broken out models for foods and meals and are planning to break out controllers to help organize our code better instead of one big file. 

5. How do you execute raw SQL in node?
- knex package lets you use knex.raw and then pass in a raw SQL query

6. What's a callback function and what are some reasons when we use/need callback functions?
- a callback function is a function passed to another function and then executed inside that function. They help with flow control - aschronicity of JS

7. What is CORS?
- it is a library/package? (not sure what to call it) that allows sites(or different domains) to communicate with eachother 

8. What are some steps to avoid CORS?
- unsure - had to google this - looks like you could use document.domain or window.postMessage? 


#### Review  

9. Why do people say "HTTP is stateless"?
- HTTP does not hold on to data - so it does not remember any previous requests. The connection is lost after the response is sent. 

10. What is a RESTful API?
- it uses GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to get/send data via HTTP requests. Based on REST architechture - representational state transfer. 

11. What are some main characteristics of a team following an agile workflow?
- iterative - smaller sprints to deliver features and get input before moving on. Planning at the begining of each sprint is important - deciding what issues/user stories to work on, turn them in to features to develop, design and test. 

12. What are some advantages/disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
- advantages: OAuth does most of the work for you - authenticating that the user is who they say they are via another site. 
- disadvantages: Your users might not have the OAuth application you are using to authenticate users. Less is in your control- you can only get the information that the OAuth client provides.
